I'm a software developer from the suburbs of Mumbai (Bombay), India.

I can usually be found tinkering on some of the Free and Open source softwares and libraries that enable us to build things and improve our lives. It's not only important in my view to build/contribute software that supports
open standards rather than walled gardens but to also run open services.

I helped found and run [LibertaCasa Networks](https://liberta.casa). Other useful links:

* [Wiki](https://libertacasa.info)
* [SSO](https://sso.casa) and one can click on 'manage my account' pr Sign up or login
* [Issue Tracker](https://git.com.de)
* [CGit](https://git.casa)

My code repositories are on [github](https://github.com/mogad0n)
and on our hosted infrastructure at [gitea](https://git.com.de/pratyushd)
