I'm a software developer from Mumbai (Bombay), India.

I can usually be found tinkering on some of the Free and Open source softwares and libraries that enable us to build things and improve our lives. It's  important in my view to not only build/contribute software that supports open standards rather than walled gardens but to also run open services.

My code repositories are on [github](https://github.com/pratyushd3v)
and on our hosted infrastructure at [gitea](https://git.com.de/pratyush)
among other projects.


I help run [LibertaCasa Network Services](https://liberta.casa)
